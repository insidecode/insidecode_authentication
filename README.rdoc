= insidecode_authentication

This is a fork from restful_authentication Rails plugin with some customizations

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

== Installation

$ rails plugin install git://github.com/insidecode/insidecode_authentication.git
